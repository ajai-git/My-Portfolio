This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a developer. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site features a clean, modern design with sections for an introduction, skills, project showcase, and contact information. It is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across both desktop and mobile devices. The website also includes smooth scrolling, interactive elements, and a contact form. This project highlights my expertise in web design, frontend development, and creating user-friendly, visually appealing websites.
